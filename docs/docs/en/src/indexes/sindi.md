# SINDI

![SINDI: per-term inverted lists grouped by window; only the lists matching the query's non-zero terms are walked and accumulated into an n_candidate-sized heap](../figures/indexes/sindi-overview.svg)

SINDI (**S**parse **IN**verted **D**ense **I**ndex) is VSAG's index for **sparse
vectors** — the kind produced by BM25, SPLADE, and other learned-sparse encoders.
Unlike the dense indexes (HGraph, IVF), SINDI operates directly on term/value
pairs and is the only VSAG index that accepts `dtype: "sparse"`.

- Source: `src/algorithm/sindi/`
- Example: [`examples/cpp/109_index_sindi.cpp`](https://github.com/antgroup/vsag/blob/main/examples/cpp/109_index_sindi.cpp)

## How it works

1. **Window-based inverted lists.** Documents are grouped into windows capped by
   `window_size`. When date labels are supplied, each window contains one exact
   date label; a label that exceeds `window_size` is split across multiple windows.
   Within each window, an inverted list per term maps a term id to the
   `(doc_id, value)` pairs that mention it.
2. **Optional pruning and quantization.** During construction, `doc_prune_ratio`
   drops low-weight terms per document, and `use_quantization` compresses the term
   values to shrink memory further.
3. **Scoring.** At query time, SINDI iterates the non-zero terms of the query,
   walks the corresponding inverted lists in each window, aggregates contributions
   into a max-heap of size `n_candidate`, and returns the top-k. When `use_reorder`
   is enabled, the candidates are re-scored against a high-precision flat copy.

Distance is returned as `1 - inner_product` so results sort ascending as in the
dense indexes.

## Quick start

```cpp
#include <vsag/vsag.h>

std::string params = R"({
    "dtype": "sparse",
    "metric_type": "ip",
    "dim": 1024,
    "index_param": {
        "term_id_limit": 30000,
        "window_size": 50000,
        "doc_prune_ratio": 0.0,
        "use_quantization": false,
        "use_reorder": false,
        "remap_term_ids": false
    }
})";
auto index = vsag::Factory::CreateIndex("sindi", params).value();

// Build a dataset of SparseVector.
auto base = vsag::Dataset::Make();
base->NumElements(n)
    ->SparseVectors(sparse_vectors)  // vsag::SparseVector*
    ->Ids(ids)
    ->Dates(dates)                   // optional std::string[n]
    ->Owner(false);
index->Build(base);

// Search.
auto query = vsag::Dataset::Make();
query->NumElements(1)->SparseVectors(&query_vec)->Owner(false);
auto result = index->KnnSearch(
    query, /*topk=*/10,
    R"({"sindi": {"n_candidate": 100, "date": "2026/07"}})").value();
```

## Build parameters

Build-time parameters live under `index_param`. `dtype` **must** be `"sparse"`
and `metric_type` **must** be `"ip"`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dim` | int | — (required) | Maximum number of non-zero elements per sparse vector. *Not* the vocabulary size. |
| `term_id_limit` | int | `1000000` | Upper bound on term id values (≥ max term id + 1, up to 50 000 000). |
| `window_size` | int | `50000` | Documents per window (range: 10 000 – 60 000). |
| `doc_prune_ratio` | float | `0.0` | Fraction of lowest-weight terms dropped per doc at build time (0.0 – 0.9). |
| `use_quantization` | bool | `false` | Quantize stored term values to cut memory; when enabled, uses 8-bit scalar quantization (SQ8). |
| `use_reorder` | bool | `false` | Keep a high-precision flat copy and rescore results (~2× memory). |
| `remap_term_ids` | bool | `false` | Remap term IDs before indexing; useful when term IDs are sparse or have large gaps. |
| `avg_doc_term_length` | int | `100` | Hint for memory estimation only. |

> **`dim` vs `term_id_limit`.** For the sparse vector `{0:0.1, 2:0.5, 177:0.8}`,
> `dim` is `3` (three non-zero entries) while `term_id_limit` must be ≥ `178`
> (largest term id + 1). Sizing `term_id_limit` to your vocabulary is the most
> common first-time mistake.

## Search parameters

Search-time parameters live under the `sindi` sub-object:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `n_candidate` | int | `0` | Candidate heap size. When `0`, defaults to `SPARSE_AMPLIFICATION_FACTOR · topk` (500×). If set, must satisfy `1 ≤ n_candidate ≤ SPARSE_AMPLIFICATION_FACTOR · topk`. |
| `query_prune_ratio` | float | `0.0` | Fraction of lowest-weight query terms skipped (0.0 – 0.9). |
| `term_prune_ratio` | float | `0.0` | Fraction of term-list entries skipped (0.0 – 0.9). |
| `date` | string | `""` | Optional date-window selector in `YYYY`, `YYYY/MM`, or `YYYY/MM/DD` form. |

SINDI chooses the heap-insertion strategy automatically from the build-time
`doc_prune_ratio` and search-time `query_prune_ratio`. With the current `0.1`
threshold, SINDI uses the distance-array insertion path when both ratios are
`<= 0.1`; if either ratio is greater than `0.1`, it uses term-list heap
insertion. The legacy
`use_term_lists_heap_insert` search parameter is ignored; configure pruning
ratios instead.

```cpp
auto result = index->KnnSearch(
    query, topk,
    R"({"sindi": {"n_candidate": 200, "query_prune_ratio": 0.1}})").value();
```

## Date-window filtering

Attach one optional date label to each build or add document with
`Dataset::Dates(const std::string*)`. Labels must use a canonical calendar form:
`YYYY`, `YYYY/MM`, or `YYYY/MM/DD`, including two-digit months and days. Documents
with the same exact label share windows; documents without a date (no dates array,
or an empty string entry) share undated windows. Different granularities are
different labels, so a `2026/05/17` document is stored only in a `2026/05/17`
window, not also in a `2026/05` window.

Pass the online query selector in the SINDI search parameters. A year selects its
year, month, and day windows; a month selects its month and day windows; a day
selects only that exact day. For example, `"date": "2026"` matches `2026`,
`2026/05`, and `2026/05/17`. A missing or empty query date disables date
filtering. A non-empty query date excludes undated windows.

Date filtering first prunes the windows to search. Any ID filter, bitset, or
`Filter` callback is then applied inside those windows, so the two filters have
AND semantics. Both KNN and range search support the date selector.

## When to use SINDI

- Sparse retrieval with BM25, SPLADE, uniCOIL, or similar learned-sparse encoders.
- Hybrid dense+sparse pipelines where SINDI handles the sparse leg in parallel with
  HGraph / IVF for dense embeddings.
- Memory-constrained deployments of sparse corpora (`use_quantization: true`
  roughly halves memory with a small recall loss; `use_reorder: true` trades
  memory for recall).

SINDI does **not** accept dense vectors and supports only inner-product similarity.
Range search and id-based filtering are supported; see the example for usage.

## Practical guidance

- For Chinese corpora, we recommend encoding sparse vectors with BGE-M3. For
    English corpora, SPLADE is the more common default.
- BGE-M3 can emit both sparse and dense vectors. Today SINDI handles the sparse
    leg, and VSAG plans to support fused sparse+dense scoring in a future release.
- Sparse vectors are not a complete replacement for BM25 full-text retrieval. In
    practice, three-way recall with BM25 + sparse + dense usually outperforms any
    two-way combination.
- At the index level, SINDI can also serve BM25-style scoring: use inverse
    document frequency as the query-side term weight, and use term-frequency-based
    weights as the document-side term value.

## Common configurations

1. Flat brute-force sparse index. Keep all non-zero terms in the inverted index
     (`doc_prune_ratio: 0.0`), disable the flat reranker (`use_reorder: false`),
     and disable quantization (`use_quantization: false`). This is the simplest
     high-recall baseline.
2. Pruned high-accuracy index. Prune most low-weight terms during build
     (`doc_prune_ratio: 0.4`), keep the flat copy for reranking
     (`use_reorder: true`), and enable quantization to shrink inverted-list memory
     (`use_quantization: true`). This is a common balance between memory and
     recall.
3. Very large sparse vocabularies. When term IDs are sparse within the `uint32`
     range, such as hash-based tokenizers, external vocabulary IDs, or vocabularies
     with large gaps, enable `remap_term_ids: true`. This avoids managing many
     empty posting lists and helps stay below the `term_id_limit` ceiling.

## Mark remove

SINDI supports `RemoveMode::MARK_REMOVE`. Calling `Remove(ids)` (the default mode)
tombstones the given ids so they no longer appear in search results;
`GetNumElements()` drops accordingly and `GetNumberRemoved()` reports the running
total. Removing an id that is absent or already removed is a no-op.
`RemoveMode::FORCE_REMOVE` is not supported and returns an error.

Mark-removed documents still occupy memory until the index is rebuilt; the space
is not physically reclaimed.
